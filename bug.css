The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentage values within a `media query`. For example, the following code does not adjust the width of the element to 50% of the viewport width when the viewport width is less than 768px:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  #myElement {
    width: calc(50% - 10px);
  }
}
```

This is because the `calc()` function does not properly handle percentages within media queries in some older browsers or when there are certain other CSS rules applied.
